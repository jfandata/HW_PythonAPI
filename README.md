# Open Weather Map API
This project is part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Certification at Washington University in St. Louis.  Other projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/jfandata).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world at varying distance from the equator. The project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to gather the necessary data. The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* R 
* Python
* D3
* PostGres, MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML
* JavaScript
* etc. 

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
